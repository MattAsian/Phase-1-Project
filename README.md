Hello, my name is Matthew, my project is a pokemon searcher using an 

external public API named Poke API, as the name implies, you search up a 

pokemon and it'll appear within your screen with it's image, name and type. 

After you've searched the pokemon, hover your mouse over the pokemon image 

and you'll be suprised with a diotto! You can turn dark mode on and off 

using the spacebar on your keyboard. 

EventListeners include keydown dark mode, click search button and the mouse 

hover Diotto!

all of this information is fetched pro Poke API
